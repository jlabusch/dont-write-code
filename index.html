                    Code reuse has come a long way.
                    Not so long ago, it was a totally normal thing for projects to roll their own
                    logging, config, message queues... All the boring and complicated shit that
                    takes time and doesn't actually solve the business need that brought you here
                    in the first place.
                    <p>
                    This is bad in many ways, even if we ignore relative quality of code and
                    availability of documentation:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Makes life harder for newcomers. There's zero chance any new hire will be
                      familiar with this stuff.
                      <li>Corollary is that you're more reliant on your current devs, which can make
                      it hard for you to properly rotate people through different internal teams
                      <li>People often wasted a lot of time over-engineering things that they thought
                      might be re-used one day, only to never actually cash in on the benefits.<br/>
                      Building a framework is a high-risk proposition.

                    Show of hands, does everyone here use Node in their day jobs? How about Ruby? Python?
                    <p>
                    We do a lot of Node and Python at Catalyst, but I think most of this
                    applies to Ruby as well.

                  <h3><em>&ldquo;Don't write code&rdquo;</em> is not a new sentiment.</h3>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    So while reuse is not a new idea, it has changed shape a lot in
                    the past 20 years, and I think the big shift has come not from
                    motivation, but in availability and DISCOVERability.
                    <p>
                    Instead of Alice adding her config parser to the company's common utils library,
                    it's now a case of publishing a module to NPM, where if you're lucky, you can
                    get feedback and even patches from other companies and hobbyists in the industry.
                    <p>
                    This has come hand-in-hand with greater acceptance of open source by
                    tech businesses - not just using, but actually contributing. Plus, empoyment
                    contracts seem to be nowhere near as OSS-unfriendly these days.

                    So when you need to do some boring generic thing, it's accepted that you
                    should first hit google and try to find an existing tool.

                  <aside class="notes">
                    Unfortunately -- and I know the plural of anecdote is not data -- I have
                    often seen people use the nearest thing to hand without really thinking
                    the choices through.<p>
                    For example, last year a company that shall remain nameless re-skinned a
                    site using jQuery 1.2 (ca. 2008). It's just what they had lying around.
                    <p>
                    This year, we tried to integrate a new thing into that site and lo and
                    behold it wouldn't play nice with jQuery 1.2. What a pointless headache.
                    <p>
                    But ok, let's assume people care enough to put in a little more effort -
                    it's still not a given they'll make good choices.

                        Here are some examples of bad criteria that I've seen people use

                        Story: PyCon Montreal speaker (Jacob Kaplan-Moss?) tweeted sudo pip install somepackage.
                        No explanation about what the package was. A bunch of curious people did.
                        The package gathered a bunch of info about their machines and uploaded it to Heroku.
                        But we'll get back to that later!

                      The first argument one can make is that most things at the Platform layer have
                      been around longer, and the longer something sticks around the more likely
                      it is to be more than just MVP.
                      <p>
                      And "more than MVP" doesn't mean bloated; I'm just talking about taking off

                        Let's start with your own code. I see plenty of small sites going up
                        with a budget of thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.<br>
                        In today's market, you probably don't have much fat in there. You need
                        to get in and out as fast as possible.
                        <p>
                        We can't even generalise about the third party modules; they run the
                        spectrum from a bright idea someone had one afternoon and threw onto
                        GitHub as v0.1 and never touched again, to stuff like Django and Express
                        that has a committed army of paid and unpaid contributors.
                        <br>
                        That's one of the key points here; you can't assume that the modules are good.
                        <p>
                        At the language layer the resource picture looks a bit better again: The
                        Node Foundation for example, requires Platinum members to commit $1mil USD
                        over 2 years.
                        <p>
                        At the OS layer, even in the Linux world, things are even better. Red Hat,
                        Ubuntu, all the big players employ dedicated security teams and so on to
                        make sure that things work as smoothly and safely as possible.<br>
                        Ubuntu, for example, has $10mil USD stashed in the Ubuntu Foundation (separate
                        from Canonical), that they haven't touched yet.<br>
                        In 2012 Red Hat took in more than a billion USD in revenue.

                    <p>
                        Re-use by copy/paste meant that the Node libyaml author had to get around to
                        patching his own copy of the native source. Just updating the OS copy of
                        the library didn't fix the problem.

                      Package signing is about proving both that the package is intact (e.g. checksum)
                      and that it was published by the real author.

                      In late 2013 PyPI folks recommended just removing the mirror authenticity APIs
                      because the reality was that nobody ever used them.

                      As with all new things, there are bugs to be worked out. Sometimes pretty fundamental
                      ones, unfortunately.
                      <p>
                      <b>In 2013</b> there was a remote code execution vulnerability on rubygems.org - someone
                      uploaded a malicious gem that caused the database configuration details, including
                      passwords, to be emailed to a paste-it note on pastie.org.
                      <p>
                      <b>In 2014</b> a classic directory traversal and static file leakage vulnerability
                      was found in the st module used by npmjs.org.<br/>
                      At roughly the same time they had an audit done by Lyft, who also found
                      <ul>
                        <li>User could publish a package and make it appear to have been published by

                        <li>You could "star" a package as another user
                        <li>Users could inject scripts into the NPM website via README and LICENSE fields

                      aware of the risks and use tools to mitigate them.

                            Deploying via git is not scalable; too slow, too much extra data.

                            is introducing moving parts that can fail.
